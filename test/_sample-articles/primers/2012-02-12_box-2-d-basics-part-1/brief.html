<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img style=\"margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; float: left;\" src=\"http://sierakowski.eu/examples/box2d_part1/Box2D_logo.png\" alt=\"Box2D logo\" />Box2D probably doesn't have to be introduced to anyone, even if you have never used it, you have probably still heard about it. This is the most popular physics simulation engine that has been ported to every popular platform available. I had a chance to work with Box2D in C++ and I have been reading tutorials from guys using it with Python, Objective-C, Java and JavaScript. So if you come from other platform than Flash, I encourage you to read this article anyway as although I'm using a Flash port here, everything works exactly the same way in other platforms. In the first part, I cover how to create a world, static and dynamic objects, how to add interaction and work with collision detection.</p>
