<p>I needed to create an utility that when installed as a global module, it would be both available as a command line tool in bash and&nbsp;as a Node module that could be imported with require function from any Node script. As&nbsp;the command line tool, i wanted it to take input in two ways: take parameters and read input from a file or take piped streams. This tip explains how this can be achieved.</p>
