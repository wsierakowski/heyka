<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Color By Shape is my first app targeted for tablets only. Currently there is only iOS version available but the plan is to have it on Android Martket as well (it's pretty easy with AIR, just I don't have currently access to enough test devices). In this article I want to share some of the issues and ways of handling them when building an iPad app.</p>
