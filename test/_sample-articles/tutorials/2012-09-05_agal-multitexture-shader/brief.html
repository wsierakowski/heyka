<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspired by the great blog post from <a href=\"http://twitter.com/devon_o\">Devon_O </a>on conversion of GLSL (OpenGL) shaders to AGAL shaders, I decided to pick one of the examples available on Shader Toy website and to my suprise it wasn't that hard to get it working. I wanted to put the example with code on the Wonderfl but I can't get it running over there so I decided to put it here. And while I put it here, why not add just few additional words about shaders in AGAL...</p>
