<p style="text-align: justify;">Nearly half year after I published a quick tutorial on how to set everything up to build AIR apps for Android, I find it pretty much outdated... At that time Flash developers could export their projects for Android using AIR 2.5 and for iOS using PFI (Packager for iPhone) which had functionalities matching AIR 2.0. On March 2011 Adobe have released AIR 2.6, which brings plenty of new features to Android but more importantly it brings them to iOS as well. In this article I will go through steps to create and publish your first simple app for both devices - Android and iPhone using Flash Professional CS5 and AIR 2.6.</p>
