<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was asked to quickly build an algorithm to find the shortest path for a labirinth game. First thing I did was check for some quick ideas on Wikipedia and found this article: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding</a>. As there was only a text description I quickly wrote a simple ActionScript 3 class returning coordinates that create the shortest path.</p>
